        The following samples render various XML documents in the browser using XSL and CSS. The 
        source code for each can be viewed through my GitHub 
        <a href="https://github.com/mikecurtis1/democode/tree/gh-pages">democode</a> repository.

            <blockquote>
            This is one of my favorite Shakespeare sonnets. And what better demonstration of a 
            document type definition (DTD) than a sonnet? A sonnet isn't just a poem. A sonnet has a 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonnet#English_.28Shakespearean.29_sonnet">well defined structure with formal names</a> for its parts: quatraine, couplet, rhyme scheme etc. I 
            express these formal elements in my <a href="https://github.com/mikecurtis1/democode/blob/gh-pages/DTD/sonnet/sonnet29.dtd">DTD</a>.

            <blockquote>
            A film description offers an interesting example for a formal document definition. Not 
            only can a film be described with rich metadata, but that data is often context-specific. 
            Consider dates. A date associated with a film could describe when the film was 
            produced or the setting date. Consider awards. Awards can be give to the film - ex. 
            National Film Registry - or to individual cast and crew members - ex. best cinematography. 
            This document's definition expresses such detail using optional and implied elements. The XLT 
            transformation handles proper labeling and punctuation of this optional content.

            format. <a href="https://www.loc.gov/marc/">MaRC</a> is the standard metadata format for 
            library catalog records and was developed by the Library of Congress. The MaRC metadata 
            schema is very granular and identifies fields 
            with alpha-numeric codes. This document is styled so that the data column has an approximately 
            50 character measure for readability.</blockquote>

            <blockquote>
            The XML of this sample is a report from Aleph - a popular 
            library catalog system. The results contain 355 books with high usage, but the
            report did not have options for limiting the results to 100 or sorting. Librarians 
            often open these XML reports in MS Excel 
            and tweak them for presentation. But, in 
            this case I created an XSL transformation to perform the sort and limit the 
            list to 100 items. Cover 
            images come from the Google Books API based 
            on ISBN's found in the report data.

            Metadata Encode and Transmission Standard (<a href="http://www.loc.gov/standards/mets/">METS</a>) 
            is a standard maintained by the Library of Congress 
            and is commonly used in digital libraries and archives. METS documents are encoded with a  
            namespace and often include other metadata schemata such as MODS and Dublin Core. This 
            sample simply lists each datum with its element name and any relevant modifier attributes.

            <blockquote>
            Encoded Archival Description (<a href="http://www.loc.gov/ead/index.html">EAD</a>) 
            is another standard maintained by the Library of Congress. It is used to create inventories 
            of archival materials. The EAD schema includes 146 elements many of which are 
            optional and can be nested. The flexibility of the schema presents a challenge when 
            displaying documents, as they can be long and complex. For this demo 
            I created a rendering that works for any EAD document. XSL is used to 
            transform all elements to nested HTML divs while jQuery <em class="code">.toggle()</em> is used to 
            animate the display as a collapsable tree. In practice it is probably best to 
            render individual EAD documents with custom stylesheets, but this 
            example demonstrates a quick way to display any EAD document.
